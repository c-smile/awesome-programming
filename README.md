Revelations of experienced kamikazes of programming

> [If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.](https://murphyslaws.net/by_topic.htm)

A curated list of words, sounds and cries from programming underworld.

## System programming

### [The Night Watch](https://coeleveld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thenightwatch.pdf) by James Mickens [(mirror)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf)

> You can’t just place a LISP book on top of an x86 chip and hope that the hardware learns about lambda calculus by osmosis

> ... if you find yourself drinking a martini and writing programs in garbage-collected, object-oriented Esperanto, 
> be aware that the only reason that the Esperanto runtime works is because there are systems people 
> who have exchanged any hope of losing their virginity for the exciting opportunity to think 
> about hex numbers and their relationships with the operating system, the hardware, and ancient blood 
> rituals that Bjarne Stroustrup performed at Stonehenge. 

### [Programming Sucks](https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks) by Peter Welch

> Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch,
> puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different 
> file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. 
> They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember 
> the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.

## Web programming 

### [Parsing HTML with RegEx](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454) by bobince et al.

> Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child 
> weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML
> with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex 
> go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide.
